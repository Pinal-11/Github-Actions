Basic Structure of a GitHub Actions Workflow

A workflow has:

|   Keyword         |   Description                                                                   |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`            | Name of the workflow (shows in GitHub Actions tab).                             |
| `on`              | Defines the event(s) that trigger the workflow (e.g. `push`, `pull_request`).   |
| `jobs`            | Contains a map of jobs to run. Each job is a collection of steps.               |
| `runs-on`         | Specifies the type of virtual machine to run the job on (e.g. `ubuntu-latest`). |
| `steps`           | List of individual actions or commands to run inside a job.                     |
| `uses`            | Uses a GitHub Action from the marketplace or a public repo.                     |
| `run`             | Runs a shell command/script on the runner.                                      |
| `with`            | Provides input parameters to an action used in `uses`.                          |
| `env`             | Sets environment variables for jobs or steps.                                   |
| `if`              | Runs a step or job conditionally based on an expression.                        |
| `needs`           | Specifies job dependencies (run this job after another job finishes).           |
| `timeout-minutes` | Sets a timeout for a job to prevent it from hanging forever.                    |
| `outputs`         | Defines outputs from a job to be consumed by other jobs.                        |
